QIdle
=====

QIdle is the Python IDE built with the PyQt GUI toolkit and pyQode.

QIdle has the following features:

- coded in 100% pure Python, using the PyQt GUI toolkit
- cross-platform: works on Windows, Unix, and OS X
- multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing, smart indent,
call tips, JEDI CODE COMPLETION and many other features
- IPython shell dock widget (a.k.a interactive interpreter) usable from both
  window types.
- project support: simply open an existing directory to import a project,
  projects have a dedicated view and support for run configurations.
- no debugger at the moment but this is planned for a future release

QIdle has two window types: the script window and the project window. The
script window is a mono document window that let you edit and run one single
python script. The project window is a multi document window that let you work
on an entire python package.
